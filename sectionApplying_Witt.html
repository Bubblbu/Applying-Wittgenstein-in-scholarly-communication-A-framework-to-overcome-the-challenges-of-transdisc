</h1><div>\label{applying-wittgenstein-in-a-therapeutic-manner}


</div><div>In the previous chapter we have established what transdisciplinarity is
and what kind of confusion and challenges we are facing within scholarly
communication. In this chapter I will reiterate Wittgenstein’s later
theory of meaning and put it into context with the previously outlined
problems. Using Read’s (2007)  notion of applying Wittgenstein I want to propose a
therapeutic framework for a scholarly communication tool. I will then further elaborate this framework relying on&nbsp;<i>technology games</i> (Coeckelbergh, 2017) and&nbsp;<i>conceptual metaphor theory</i> (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 2003).</div><div>

<i>Meaning is use</i>. Wittgenstein’s famous and well-discussed turn
from his Tractarian picture theory of meaning based in logic to a more
socially embedded understanding of meaning based in the very usage of
our words (Crary &amp; Read, 2000, p2f). I shall at this point not go into a detailed discussion of
the early and late Wittgenstein, but simply note that I am, for the sake
of clarity and brevity, assuming the later Wittgenstein’s view (also
taking into account that my field of expertise lies in the realm of
engineering and applying, rather than Wittgensteinian exegesis). The
confusion caused by words in scholarly communication can be, in
Wittgensteinian terms,  accounted by the different usages by researchers in their  essays,
tweets, or conversations. It is interesting to note that this basic idea
 seemingly sits well with Thomas Kuhn’s social epistemology put
forth in&nbsp;<i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i> (1963). This
particular line of thought is further examined by Gunnel (2014) who, in
his book&nbsp;<i>Social Inquiry After Wittgenstein and Kuhn: Leaving
Everything as It Is</i> , claims that not only Wittgenstein and Kuhn are
both important to social inquiry but, according to him, Kuhn is “an
exemplification of Wittgenstein’s approach to philosophy” (Kindi,
2015). In his review of the book Kindi (ibid.) further points out the
interesting angle and new connections that Gunnel brought up, but is
emphasising that both Wittgenstein’s and Kuhn’s original work contain
arguments that partially refute Gunnel’s work. In a similar vein I hope
to point out a new perspective on the ways Wittgenstein’s work could be
used in productive ways in today’s technology-driven scholarly
communication.

But how can we make use of technology and scholarly communication to
exemplify Wittgenstein’s approach to philosophy and, most importantly,
make a practical impact rather than simply proving a theoretical point?
Read (2007) suggests three criteria to differentiate between actually
applying Wittgensteinian and, as Read calls them, pseudo-applications.
He states that the resolute application of Wittgenstein requires three
criteria to be fulfilled (Read, 2007, p.135):</div><ol><li> 


moving beyond exegesis,</li><li> 


extending Wittgenstein’s insights or taking them to domains
where he did not particularly focus,</li><li> 


taking in a domain of thought or life that is of some moment
beyond the academy



</li></ol><div>

Furthermore, and most importantly, Read emphasises the importance of
seeking ‘the same kind of thing’ that Wittgenstein tried to do with his
work, namely “in puncturing delusions that we are prone to, and helping
us to attain peace with regard to our words” (Read, 2007,p.134). It is
this Wittgensteinian understanding of the therapeutic application that
hopefully discerns this approach from others that mostly seek
formalisation or theorisation (whether that be Wittgensteinian
philosophy or other theories and concepts that are adopted by
engineers).</div><div>I believe that it is possible to operate in the realm of
applications and to use Wittgenstein as a guiding principle without
attempting the formalization of his thought. This way of designing and
using technology resembles the idea of the therapeutic reading of
Wittgenstein. For instance, the&nbsp;<i>New Wittgenstein</i> by Alice Crary
et al (2000) is an interpretation of Wittgenstein that supports the
previous notion of resisting the temptation of formalisation and
theorisation of Wittgenstein. While the classic narrative about the aim
of philosophising in Wittgenstein revolves around the turn from the
Tractarian metaphysical account of meaning to the later seemingly
strictly non-metaphysical account of our linguistic practices, this
disregard of metaphysics in his dealings with language is often taken as
the therapeutic aim of Wittgenstein’s later writings. The New
Wittgenstein now argues that this aim of ‘philosophy as therapy’ is not
only limited to his later writings but can be seen consistently
throughout all phases. Once again – knowing that this may attract
dismay and disappointment of some readers – I want to note that I am
neither pursuing the exegesis of Wittgenstein’s and other scholar’s
works, nor do I believe that such discussion serves the purpose of this
essay. Following Read’s and other proponNew Wittgensteinian suggestion I want to
apply Wittgenstein to technology in scholarly communication, in such a
way that does not simply reify or extend one of his concepts into
engineering, but seeks the aim of a final therapeutical application.</div>
