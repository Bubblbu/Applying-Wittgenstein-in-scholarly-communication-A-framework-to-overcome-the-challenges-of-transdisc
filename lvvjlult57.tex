\caption{I am aware that the contents of this table strongly depend on the individual paper, blog post, tweet, etc. Still, I have tried to depict a general transdisciplinary case: E.g., typically articles are written and read by researchers in one field of research, thus containing the potential for transdisciplinary confusion.}
