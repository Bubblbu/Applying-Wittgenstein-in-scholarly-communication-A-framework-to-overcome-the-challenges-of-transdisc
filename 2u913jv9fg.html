<div>While one could argue that the bulk of Wittgenstein's work deals with (the mysteries) of communication, in this essay I want to address two new domains that Wittgenstein did not address in the specific way I am. The first one is scholarly communication, which is a special case of our language use as  the academic setting and highly specialised terminology perfectly fits the critical use-cases of language that Wittgenstein has been talking about. The second domain is technology.</div><div>Times have changed since Wittgenstein’s musings about the nature of philosophy, and are still drastically changing with ever-accelerating technological advances. Unsurprisingly the philosophy of technology has been established as a discipline of its own. This is also why the journal&nbsp;<i>Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology</i> has issued a call for a special issue  about “Wittgenstein and the philosophy of technology”, and why  this investigation into Wittgenstein and scholarly communication in the light of modern technology qualifies as a domain that is worth venturing into. Just as Wittgenstein reminds us to be aware of the situatedness of the words in our everyday language (Wittgenstein, 1953, §116), I want to place the theories of scholarly communication in the everyday reality of scholarly communication. While many researchers of scholarly communication are addressing questions such as “why” and “how” researchers communicate in today's society, I want to propose a technical solution that qualifies as a “resolute practice of Wittgensteinian philosophy” (Read, 2007, p.134).</div><div>To do so I want to first discuss the nature of transdisciplinary communication and the challenges that arise from it. I will give an  overview of what modern scholarly communication entails and how advancing technology is transforming it. Having established a basic terminology and outlined the problems related to scholarly communication, I will briefly review what it means to “apply Wittgenstein” while keeping his view of “philosophy as therapy” in mind. Next, I will address the kinds of confusions caused by transdisciplinary communication and technology respectively. I want to discuss the central role that metaphors play in Wittgenstein’s work and&nbsp;consequently introduce &nbsp;<i>conceptual metaphor theory</i> (Lakoff &amp; Johnson’s, 2003) as a  practical framework to analyse and think about metaphors in our cognition. Mark Coeckelbergh’s (2017)&nbsp;<i>technology games</i> will similarly serve as a framework to understand technology in Wittgensteinian terms and will help to understand social, historical, and cultural challenges of and in technology. Finally, I will briefly discuss Open Knowledge Maps, a visual knowledge discovery tool, in terms of conceptual metaphor theory and technology games in order to show how this approach is applied in a modern scholarly communication.</div><div>I am aware that this attempt to cover various levels of analysis across multiple disciplines and theories might fail to adequately address minute details in bigger picture. Nevertheless, but I believe that  understanding and applying Wittgenstein requires “taking in a domain of thought or life that is of some moment beyond the academy” (Read, 2007, p.134). Understanding the risks of widening my focus, I hope to, nevertheless, show how this line of thought could not only prove to be fruitful to scholarly communication, but Wittgenstein scholars and philosophers of technology as well.</div>
