<h1 class="ltx_title_section">A Case Study: Open Knowledge
Maps</h1><div>\label{a-case-study-open-knowledge-maps}


</div><div>In the previous two chapters I have addressed the two possible sources
of confusion in scholarly communication technology. With Lakoff &amp;
Johnson’s conceptual metaphor theory and Coeckelbergh’s
language games we have found two interesting tools which we can
use to analyse scholarly communication technology. In this chapter I
will introduce Open Knowledge Maps /footnote{}(Kraker et al., 2017) as a potential tool that overcomes
some of the problems of modern scholarly communication.</div><div>


</div><div>OKM is a visual knowledge discovery tool that provides an overview of a
research field based on available metadata and abstract of relevant
articles. The full technical implementation and code is available online
as Open Source code22https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/Headstart.
The authors furthermore have described the future work and features that
are planned (Kraker, Kittel and Enkhbayar, 2016). The basic search
functionality resembles any other standard academic search engine, but
the results are then presented in an interactive, what the authors call,
knowledge map . These knowledge maps consist of individual items
(publications) and topic bubbles which are calculated based on the
available metadata abstracts of the items (see fig. 1) While the team’s
current focus is mostly on the improvement of the current language
processing algorithms in order to increase the quality of the extracted
topics, groupings, and labelling, I want to selectively zone in on a few
aspects that might be of more interest than the algorithmic
implementation. Specifically I want to, once again, return to the
conceptual metaphor theory and language games to see how
OKM might be addressing certain issues in scholarly communication
differently than other solutions.</div>
