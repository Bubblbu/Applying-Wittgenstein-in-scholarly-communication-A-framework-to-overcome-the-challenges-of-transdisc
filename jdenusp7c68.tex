In the previous two chapters I have addressed the two possible sources of confusion in scholarly communication technology. With Lakoff & Johnson’s conceptual metaphor theory and Coeckelbergh’s
language games we have found two interesting tools which we can
use to analyse scholarly communication technology. In this chapter I
will introduce Open Knowledge Maps /footnote{From now on simply referred to as OKM }(Kraker et al., 2017) as a potential tool that overcomes
some of the problems of modern scholarly communication.
