<div><i>Conceptual metaphor theory</i>. The most obvious feature that
attracts attention is the way information is presented in OKM. Papers
are grouped into bubbles of similar content and the user can further
explore individual bubbles to see more details. In of their proposals
the authors argue that this visualization comes with cognitive benefits
as the mental workload is kept to reasonable size by leveraging
different levels of abstraction. While this approach has been user
tested in Kraker et al. (2015) I believe that the the true benefit in
terms of cognition is due to the metaphoric structure of these
visualizations. It is possible to break down the interface using Lakoff
and Johnson’s conceptual metaphor theory. We usually think of
research disciplines and fields as container metaphors (e.g., “to be IN
the social sciences”) and similarly the bubbles serve as containers for
specific papers. The users can literally click and dive into a bubble or
research field to explore the elements within. Several orientational
metaphors are at work when the proximity of bubbles are indicating the
topical relatedness of bubbles and the introduction of layers (the
authors are proposing nested layers of topics as a future feature) also
fit our natural understanding of research fields as sub- and
supercategories. Finally, another very powerful structural metaphor  is
already pointed out by the creators and the name of the tool, namely
that of maps and cartography. Humans use maps to navigate space; they
can either serve to orientate one in both new and familiar regions and
by varying the amount of detail a map can either give an overview of a
continent or meticulously describe the alleys of Palermo. Furthermore,
it is interesting to point out that the maps produced by OKM are not to
be understood as static, objectively true snapshots of the world. While
the common understanding and usage of cartographic maps might rely on
such an assumption (navigating the seas was a daunting, if not
impossible, task before the introduction of the mercator projection
which finally allowed for the p angles and directions) it is important to
remember that every two dimensional map is a projection that introduces
distortions. If the cartographic metaphor is be taken serious, knowledge
maps will take on various projections of concepts (currently 100 most
relevant concepts are condensed based on their metadata and abstracts)
depending on the purpose of the user.
