<div>In times of ever accelerating technological progress scholarly communication is increasingly inter- and cross-disciplinary; posing the challenge of communicating specialized terminology across disciplines. In this paper I want to illustrate how a therapeutic application of Wittgenstein coupled with modern technology can help to overcome this problem. Instead of attempting to formalise or theorise Wittgenstein's idea to address the challenges an application of Wittgenstein is proposed which attempts to utilise technology in a therapeutic manner that clears away the mist of confusion caused by the use of (interdisciplinary) language. This essay is an attempt to show a potentially fruitful way of using Wittgenstein to engage in the applied sciences. Furthermore, the challenge at hand, communicating transdisciplinary can enter a productive relationship. One the one hand I will elaborate on Mark Coeckelbergh’s (2017) technology games which provides ample grounds for further discussion of technology and communication in Wittgensteinian terms. On the other I will introduce Lakoff &amp; Johnson’s (2008) conceptual metaphor theory as a framework for the mechanics of a system that is required to improve interdisciplinary communication. Lastly, I will discuss and evaluate Open Knowledge Maps (Kraker, Kittel &amp; Enkhbayar, 2016) in the light of the previous theories as a real world example of such a system. By doing so I hope to not only theorize and talk about, but also show a way of applying Wittgenstein in a modern and technology-driven scholarly communication.</div>
