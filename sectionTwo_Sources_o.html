<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Two Sources of Confusion</h1><div>\label{two-sources-of-confusion}


</div><div>After making clear how I am hoping to apply Wittgenstein I want to
discuss the delusions caused not only by our words, but also the
technology surrounding us. In the particular case of scholarly
communication and technology, we saw that the former can cause confusion
in various ways, but technology itself is also prone to confusing its
users. It is both cases that I want to address in the next paragraphs,
while respectively proposing theories that might help to understand and
further analyse the way we use our words and technology in scholarly
communication.


</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Communication &amp; Conceptual Metaphor
Theory</h2><div>\label{communication-conceptual-metaphor-theory}


</div><div>A central theme in Wittgenstein’s work are metaphors — either as an
object of investigation or as a philosophical and investigative method
to convey his messages to his readers. Let us have a look at both cases
in detail.


</div><blockquote><div>”If the word ’mind’ is a noun, then the word ’mind’ must be the name of
some thing. As the word ’book’ is the name of some thing. And so if a
book is made of paper, then what is the mind made of? And if a book is
on the table, then where is the mind? And if reading a book is done with
the eyes, then is thinking done with the mind?” (Wittgenstein, 1953, §
351)


</div></blockquote><div>According to Wittgenstein the cause for the profound confusions caused
by our words are misleading metaphors and analogies. Gill (1979)
skillfully summarises Wittgenstein’s remarks and thoughts regarding the
function and role of metaphors across the Tractatus, Philosophical
Investigations, and On-Certainty:


</div><blockquote><div>“Not only does he maintain that metaphoric expression runs deeper than
propositional expression, but his method of presentation is itself
metaphorical in nature. In a word, he doesn’t present ”knock-down,
drag-out arguments” for his view, because his view is that such
arguments do not cut deep enough.” (Gill, 1979, p.284)


</div></blockquote><div>Every reader of Wittgenstein is familiar with his avid usage of
metaphors in his prose. If one takes Wittgenstein’s opinion about the
epistemic value of metaphors into account, one can see that this style
of writing is intended to be more than just elaborate and figurative
speech. Rather Wittgenstein tries to appeal to our very foundation of
our experience with the metaphoric mode “as it constitutes the heart of
everyday speech, because it is at the practical level of existence that
we are closest to the bedrock of our form of life” (ibid.). Gill thus
concludes that any abstract thought consists and must be evaluated by
metaphors. This final verdict emphasises the central role of metaphors
in Wittgenstein’s work.


</div><div>Despite having determined the place and role of metaphors in our
language and very existence Wittgenstein did not embark on a journey to
construct a systematic theory of metaphors. In this regard, George
Lakoff and Mark Johnson wrote a whole book dedicated to the cognitive
function and workings of metaphors called Metaphors We Live By .
They basically argue that metaphors structure our everyday experience
and accordingly those “metaphors we live by” are more than simple
linguistic expressions. It is interesting to note that the the authors
only mention Wittgenstein once; a brief acknowledgment of their views of
family resemblance. This limited recognition and investigation of
Wittgenstein’s work is also addressed by Rogers (2015), while Martins
(2010) notes that a fundamental difference between Wittgenstein and
Lakoff and Johnson might be regarding the aim of philosophy. In
Philosophy in the Flesh Lakoff and Johnson (1999, p.4) pose the
question if one could take these findings “about the nature of mind and
constructed philosophy anew?”. An idea that doesn’t go well with
Wittgenstein’s thought, who, in his earlier writings, suggests that
philosophy is like a ladder. The successful practitioner must “must, so
to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it” (Tractatus,
6.54). Nevertheless, while they may disagree about the nature of
philosophy, both theories seem to place metaphors at a central location
within the human existence.


</div><div>The reason why I am introducing Lakoff &amp; Johnson (2003) is that their
systematic and detailed account of the mechanics of our metaphoric
understanding might give some hints on how to overcome the problems that
the same metaphors cause.


</div><blockquote><div>“Because so many of the concepts that are important to us are either
abstract or not clearly delineated in our experience (the emotions,
ideas, time, etc.), we need to get a grasp on them by means of other
concepts that we understand in clearer terms (spatial orientations,
objects, etc.)” (Lakoff &amp; Johnson 1980, 115).


</div></blockquote><div>In their seminal work Metaphors we live by Lakoff and Johnson
then continue to further classify the kind of metaphors that our mind
deploys:</div><ol><li> 


Structural Metaphors use one concept to structure another
concept. Lakoff &amp; Johnson use the example of ‘argument as war’ to
illustrate the metaphorical structures that we use in our everyday
language.
</li><li><div>




Orientational Metaphors exploit the fact that humans are physical beings with a certain orientation and direction in space. Concepts are put into relation to each other using orientations based on our experience (e.g., up/down as upright bipedal beings, in/out as our physical bodies are distinct from the outer environment)</div><div></div></li><li><div>Ontological Metaphors are finally those metaphors that help to understand our experiences in terms of other objects and substances. This mode of thought is again based in our very experience as physical beings. A special kind of ontological metaphor that the authors bring up is the container metaphor which are specified by their attribution of a territory or boundary. </div><div></div></li><div></div></ol><div> 
</div><ol><div>
</div><li><div></div><div></div></li><div>
</div></ol><div>


</div><div>According to Lakoff and Johnson all these metaphors have a grounding in
our physical and cultural experience. An important detail as the
embedding of our most basic mode of cognition, the metaphoric mode, in
our culture makes our cognition itself a socially rooted one. This is
quite compatible with Wittgenstein’s notion of language-games and forms
of life. They further note that purely intellectual concepts such as
concepts in scientific theories are almost always based on metaphors
with a physical/cultural basis (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 2003, p.19).</div><div>



</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Technology &amp; Technology
Games</h2><div>\label{technology-technology-games}


</div><div>In the previous section I addressed the kind of confusion that can be
caused by our communication using Wittgenstein’s work and usage of
metaphors. The conceptual metaphor theory provides a useful frame of
operations for a metaphorical account of our cognition. The other source
of confusion in modern scholarly communication is technology. In order
to further investigate the nature of that technological confusion I am
using Mark Coeckelbergh’s concept of technology games (2017)
which in itself is a holistic account of technology using Wittgenstein’s
philosophy of language.</div><div>


</div><div>Coeckelbergh points a variety of potentially fruitful points of
departure for an investigation of Wittgenstein’s understanding of
language and the philosophy of technology, but finally focusses on a
very specific case: He suggests to reverse the famous metaphor of
language as a toolbox (Wittgenstein, 1953, §11) and suggests to think
about technology in terms of Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language,
understood as a tool. What seems to be starting off as a mundane
use-oriented understanding of technology — as Coeckelbergh notes
others have also proposed similar ideas (e.g., Ihde, 1990; Franssen and
Koller, 2016) — is then further developed into an interesting account
of technology grounded in what he calls technology games . This
embedding of technology in a cultural, social, and historical context
proves to be further useful as Coeckelbergh continues to extend
Wittgenstein’s notion of grammar to a surface grammar and
depth grammar of technology. While the surface grammar can be
understood as the immediate syntax of technology usage (i.e.,
instructions on how to use an appliance), the depth grammar refers to
those rules which are not easily expressed or recorded by looking at
individual cases of technology or its usage. Rather one has to take the
pre-existing activities and technologies into account. Coeckelbergh
gives the example of a social robot which comes with the basic operating
instructions needed to use it. But to fully grasp the usage of such a
robot is to to grasp the “deeper” grammar which is grounded in the
social rules and forms of life. The “social” robot would not be much
of a social technology if “social games” wouldn’t be part of our human
existence:</div><div>


</div><div>“The technology grammar is related to wider social and cultural
grammars, which clearly have a normative dimension. Like our use of
language, our use of technology enters and follows a river-bed that was
already there before us and before our particular use.” (Coeckelbergh,
2017, p.13)</div><div>


</div><div>I want to further use the concepts of surface and depth grammar of
technology to examine the confusions that are brought about by
technology. Unsurprisingly wrong instructions or faulty execution can
lead to confusion when technology is used. Syntactical errors in the
surface grammar of technology are those mistakes and bugs in technology
which can be spotted by a systematic comparison of the ideal and actual
state. This could be compared to the process of writing a grammar
checker for written text. On the other hand, the confusion caused by the
depth grammar of technology are more subtle and harder to spot. A user
interface designed for a Japanese audience might be confusing to the
European user simply because of the different reading directions.
Similarly technology and its design might be historically culturally
influenced, such as the concept of pagination, which makes clearly sense
in the case of static written text (printed books, standard PDFs) but
can equally be confusing in other cases (eBook readers that reflow the
text based on screen size and font size). I believe that the concept of
technology games and technology grammar is a nice fit in order to
capture these various kinds of confusions that arise from using
technology.</div><div>


</div><div>Coeckelbergh (2017, p.15) identifies three tasks of a “Wittgensteinian
holistic, transcendental, and critical phenomenology and hermeneutics of
technology”: (1) the revelation of both surface and depth grammar of
technology, (2) reveal the normativity of those technology
grammars11We can not use technology without following the rules
imposed on us by the social and historical context, and (3) make us
aware of the active, “game-changing”22A great example for a
game-changer might be the introduction of social media. Nobody
would question the manifold ways that this technology influenced the
very nature of communication, socialising, and even politics. nature
of technology and forsake the idea of the neutral tool. Coeckelbergh
concludes that “thinking about technology is also thinking about the
ways we do things, and ultimately about our world and an entire form of
life.” It is interesting to note that while this way of thinking might
be novel in the context of the philosophy of technology, engineers and
designers had adopted a similar way of thinking and conceiving
technology many years ago. User-centric design, soft ergonomics, or
human-computer interaction are a few examples of technology design
strategies that were immensely popularised by works such as User
Centered System Design: New perspectives on human-computer interaction
(Donald and Draper, 1986) or the more recent Designing with the
mind in mind: simple guide to understanding user interface design
guidelines (Johnson, 2010). Awareness for the cultural, social, and
historical embedding of a user of technology have been part of software
development and engineering for some time and an extensive investigation
of interface design strategies might be an interesting future task in
the context of technology games .</div>
