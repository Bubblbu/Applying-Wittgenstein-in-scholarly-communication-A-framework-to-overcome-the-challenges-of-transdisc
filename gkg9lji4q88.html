</div><div>In this essay I have tentatively tried to outline how a Wittgensteinian
approach could overcome the challenges of transdisciplinary
communication. Wittgenstein was fascinated by our language, the way it
works, and more importantly, how it often fails to work. Scholarly
communication is as diverse as our everyday communication and equally
technology-driven as the everyday counterpart. Thus, I have tried to
confirm to the criteria of applying Wittgenstein according to Read’s
(2007) in order to outline a possible framework to solve the problems
posed by both technology and communication. Scholarly communications
technology that does ‘the same kind of thing’ that Wittgenstein pursued
with his philosophy has to resolve the confusions and seemingly
disappear as a tool, just like the Wittgensteinian ladder which is
disposed after ascending it. Just like glasses which disappear from the
perception of the wearer I’ve described an application grounded in
technology games and conceptual metaphor theory that
addresses those confusions brought about by communication and
technology. Finally, I looked at the visual knowledge discovery tool
Open Knowledge Maps through the lenses of the two theories. I believe
that this real life example shows how the overall approach a therapeutic
design of technology might prove to be an interesting area of further
investigation in the context of modern scholarly communication. This
investigation of Wittgenstein, philosophy of technology and
communication depicts a non-philosopher’s tentative approach to engaging
in an applied and empirical philosophy of technology.</div>
