</div><div>Before tackling any WIttgensteinian  concepts I want
to clarify my understanding and use of transdisciplinarity.
Furthermore I will introduce scholarly communication as a research field
and activity, before finally listing some specific modes of
communication and their respective problems.</div><div></div><div>

When it comes to describing research that engages multiple disciplines
there are usually three different terms that are moreover often used
interchangeably: multidisciplinary (MD), interdisciplinary (ID) and
transdisciplinary (TD) research. Holbrock (2013, p.1866, italics are
his) provides the following definitions and suggests that their usage
has been commonly agreed upon in the scholarly community. According to
them:</div><ul><li>


 


MD refers to the (mere) <i>juxtaposition</i> of two or more academic
disciplines focused on a single problem.&nbsp;</li><li> 


ID refers to the <i>integration</i> of two or more disciplines focused
on a common (and, it is sometimes insisted, a <i>complex</i>) problem.&nbsp;</li><li> 


TD refers to the integration of one or more academic disciplines with
<i>extra-academic perspectives</i> on a common (and usually a
<i>real-world</i>, as opposed to a merely academic) problem.&nbsp;
</li></ul><div></div><div>We can see that the important distinction is between MD and ID/TD, as
the former merely provides a juxtaposition of two disciplines while the
latter requires some form of integration. In the following essay
I will use the term transdisciplinary as a placeholder for both ID and
TD research activities for the sake of legibility. Furthermore, I want to repeat that the kind of communication that is discussed in this essay only occurs in ID or TD settings.</div><div>Having defined the scope of transdisciplinarity I want to specifically
address the nature of modern scholarly communication in the light the rapid
technological advancements. As often is the case,
the term scholarly communication has been coined and defined by many
with varying scope and vagueness of the term (Halliday, 2001). The UK
research assessment exercise (RAE) defined scholarly communication as
“the creation, development and maintenance of the intellectual
infrastructure of subjects and disciplines, in forms such as
dictionaries, scholarly editions, catalogues and contributions to major
research databases”, a notably narrow and specific definition that is
focussing on traditional final outputs of the research process. A better
suited definition for our purposes is provided by Borgman (1990, p.13f)
who says that scholarly communication is “how scholars in any
field… use and disseminate information through formal and
informal channels”. This definition encapsulates informal and formal
channels of communication and furthermore differentiates between the
scholar as the recipient and disseminator of information. Moreover, it
includes the traditional publication channels such as journals or books
but also modern ones such as preprints, blogs, or any other means of
communicating research information.


</div><div>How do these various modes and means of communication differ in regard
to the challenges that transdisciplinary communication poses? A central
question is how to deal with definitions and terminology. The example of
‘paradigms’ shows that the word has very different meanings depending on
the background of the person using it. While a historian of science (and
many other scientists and philosophers) will think of Thomas Kuhn’s
theory of scientific progress, a person working in neuroscience might
rather think of fMRI experimental designs. Furthermore, the word is also
used in non-academic settings to indicate an prototypical case of
something. This simple example illustrates how a seemingly ubiquitous
concept such as paradigms would be misinterpreted by a
philosophically untrained neuroscientist. Let us go a step further and
look at the kinds of troubles that communication could cause across different modes of  communication in scholarship.

</div><div>The scholarly research article exists since the foundation of the first academic journal&nbsp;<i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</i> in 1665. The scientific paper has since been treated as the main output of scientists and scholars alongside with the book and thesis as more extensive formats. Its own style of writing is typically regarded as grammatically complex, elaborate, and explicit in expressing meanings, especially in contrast to everyday conversations. Biber and Gray (2010)  investigate this commonplace assumption of a difference between academic writing and speech, and come to the conclusion that while academic writing does indeed differ from everyday language, it is neither grammatically more elaborate nor explicit in its meaning.</div><blockquote><div>"In contrast to the academic professional, the compact, inexplicit  discourse styles of research articles are difficult for novice students.  This is because students lack the specialist knowledge that would allow  them to readily infer the expected meaning of compact, inexplicit  constructions." (Biber and Gray, 2010, p.19)</div></blockquote><div>Biber and Gray (2010, p.5)  analysed 429 research articles dating back to 1965 and across four disciplines (science/medicine, education, psychology, history), but since then the world has changed significantly and scholarly publishing is still in a turbulent phase of rapid changes and revolutions (Odlyzko, 2002). Especially the last two decades of technological advances, i.e. the Web 2.0, have had significant impact on how scholarship defines and assesses their communication among peers and the general public (Ponte and Simon, 2011). For instance, academics have fully embraced Social Media not only as part of their personal and professional communication (with dedicated platforms for academia such as ResarchGate or Academia.edu), but the very nature of the knowledge creation is being influenced, as can be seen in the case of changes and innovation in peer review  (Tennant et al., 2017). Furthermore, communication with the public (i.e.,&nbsp;<i>science communication,&nbsp;</i>in contrast to&nbsp;<i>scholarly communication</i> among peers) and even involvement and engagement have become vital parts of the work of an academic. Ponte and Simon (2011) show that there is a positive attitude towards the new forms of communication (e.g., blogs, wikis, social net,&nbsp;</div><div>At the end of this paper I will look at the very
specific case of a platform that attempts to communicate scientific
concepts and discuss a possible solution within a technological and
philosophical framework.&nbsp;</div>
